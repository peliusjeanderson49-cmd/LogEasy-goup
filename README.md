## Application Idea  

- The idea of this application is to allow humanitarian organizations that carry out large-scale logistical activities to find a platform that enables them to manage their needs with a single click. As its name suggests, LogEasy aims to make logistics tasks easy.  

- The final goal is to:  
  - Track stock levels in real time.  
  - Optimize product placement in the warehouse.  
  - Facilitate order preparation (picking) and shipping.  

- Transport Management System (TMS):  
  - Plan and optimize delivery routes to reduce costs and time.  
  - Select the best carriers.  
  - Manage transport documentation and billing.  

- Tracking and Visibility:  
  - Locate goods from departure to arrival (end-to-end visibility).  
  - Provide tracking information to clients and partners.  

- Advanced Planning System (APS):  
  - Use data analytics for demand forecasting.  
  - Synchronize production, transport, and storage for maximum efficiency.  

- Integration:  
  - Connect the logistics application with other company systems (ERP, online ordering systems) for better collaboration and transparent information sharing.
